# BetaFunctionsGrav
Computing Propagators and One Loop Beta Functions for some Higher Derivative Gravitational Theory.

The aim at the moment is to develop some automatized routine in order to check the calculations done in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02882 ) by C.Pagani and R.Percacci, and extend them beyond.
